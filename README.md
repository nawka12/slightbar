# SlightBar: Your Universal Search and Command Bar

SlightBar is a sleek and powerful universal search and command bar for your desktop. It's designed to be a lightweight and fast way to access your applications, files, and commands with just a few keystrokes.

## Features

- **Universal Search**: Quickly find and launch applications, files, and folders on your system.
- **Command Execution**: Run shell commands directly from the bar.
- **Web Search**: Seamlessly search the web by prefixing your query with a keyword (e.g., `g search term`).
- **Customizable Hotkey**: Activate SlightBar from anywhere with a custom global hotkey.
- **Extensible**: The plugin-based architecture (coming soon) will allow for a wide range of additional features.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
