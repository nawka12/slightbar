# SlightBar: Your Universal Search and Command Bar

SlightBar is a sleek and powerful universal search and command bar for Windows. Built with Flutter, it provides lightning-fast access to your applications, files, and AI-powered assistance with just a few keystrokes.

## ‚ú® Features

### üîç **Local Search & Indexing**
- **Application Search**: Quickly find and launch installed Windows applications.
- **Fast File Search**: Uses a background indexing service running in an isolate for near-instant file searches with zero UI blocking.
- **Multi-Drive Support**: Indexes user folders and all connected drives with intelligent recovery from interrupted sessions.
- **Smart Navigation**: Use arrow keys to navigate results, Enter to launch.
- **Background Processing**: All file indexing happens in a separate isolate, keeping the UI responsive at all times.

### üéØ **Platform Support**
- **Primary**: Windows 10/11
- **Architecture**: Universal Windows Platform support
- **Distribution**: Automated installer with Inno Setup

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK** (3.6.1 or later) - [Installation Guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- **Windows 10/11** with development tools enabled

### Installation Options

#### Option 1: Pre-built Installer (Recommended)
1. Download the latest `SlightbarSetup.exe` from releases
2. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard
3. Launch SlightBar from Start Menu or Desktop shortcut

#### Option 2: Build from Source

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nawka12/slightbar.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd slightbar
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Run for the first time:**
   The first time you run the app, it will begin indexing your files in the background using a dedicated isolate. This ensures the UI remains responsive while indexing proceeds. You can continue to use the app for application search and AI commands while indexing is in progress.
   ```bash
   flutter run -d windows
   ```

   Or build for release:
   ```bash
   flutter build windows --release
   ```

5. **Build installer (Optional):**
   ```bash
   build_installer.bat
   ```

?What's the latest news about AI?
```

### Settings Configuration

Access settings with `!s` to configure:

- **Theme**: Switch between Light, Dark, or System themes.
- **AI Tools**: Enable/disable web search, scraping, weather, and prayer times.
- **Excluded Drives**: Provide a comma-separated list of drive letters to exclude from indexing (e.g., `D, E`).
- **AI Provider**: Choose between Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini.
- **AI Models**: Customize models for each provider.
- **API Keys**: Set up keys for cloud AI providers.
- **SearxNG URL**: Configure your self-hosted search instance.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental Features & Important Notes

- **Multi-Drive Indexing**: The feature to index non-system drives is **highly experimental and can be very slow**, especially on drives with a large number of files or a large Master File Table (MFT).
- **`!reindex` Command**: Use the `!reindex` command with caution. It triggers a full re-scan of all included drives, which can be resource-intensive and take a significant amount of time. It is recommended to let the initial indexing complete and only use this command if absolutely necessary.
- **Initial Index**: The file index is stored in `%APPDATA%\slightbar\file_index.jsonl` with progress tracking and recovery capabilities for interrupted sessions.
- **Background Processing**: All file operations run in isolates to maintain UI responsiveness during heavy indexing operations.

## üîß AI Tools Setup

### Ollama (Local AI Provider)

**Important**: Ollama requires local installation and only works with locally hosted models. 

To use Ollama with SlightBar:
1. **Install Ollama**: Download from [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)
2. **Pull the default model**: Run `ollama pull qwen3:8b` in your terminal
3. **Verify installation**: Ensure Ollama is running locally on the default port

Ollama provides privacy-focused AI processing entirely on your machine without requiring internet connectivity or API keys.

### SearXNG (Required for Web Tools)

The web search and scraping features require a locally running [SearXNG](https://github.com/searxng/searxng-docker) instance for privacy and reliability.

**Quick Setup with Docker:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/searxng/searxng-docker.git
cd searxng-docker
docker-compose up -d
```

SearXNG will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8080` (default configuration).

### API Keys for Cloud Providers

1. **OpenAI**: Get your API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. **Anthropic**: Get your API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
3. **Google Gemini**: Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)

Enter these in Settings (`!s`) for the respective providers.
