## üîß AI Tools Setup

### Ollama (Local AI Provider)

**Important**: Ollama requires local installation and only works with locally hosted models. 

To use Ollama with SlightBar:
1. **Install Ollama**: Download from [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)
2. **Pull the default model**: Run `ollama pull qwen3:8b` in your terminal
3. **Verify installation**: Ensure Ollama is running locally on the default port

Ollama provides privacy-focused AI processing entirely on your machine without requiring internet connectivity or API keys.

### SearXNG (Required for Web Tools)

The web search and scraping features require a locally running [SearXNG](https://github.com/searxng/searxng-docker) instance for privacy and reliability.

**Quick Setup with Docker:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/searxng/searxng-docker.git
cd searxng-docker
docker-compose up -d
```

SearXNG will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8080` (default configuration).

### API Keys for Cloud Providers

1. **OpenAI**: Get your API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. **Anthropic**: Get your API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
3. **Google Gemini**: Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/)

Enter these in Settings (`!s`) for the respective providers.
